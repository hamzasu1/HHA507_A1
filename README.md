# I apologize for the assignment being late as I received my laptop on 9/13/2025 and was unable to download Snowmed and Rxnorm till I got permission from the nlm.nhi.gov website which was on 9/15/2025. I will accept the lateness penalty for this assignment.
# Created 7 outputs for each Medical Codex.
# In the requirements file, I added all libraries that were added in class from a lecture.
# Please run each code as I was unable to leave the output in the file due to storage issues
# I tried to upload to github using the large files powerpoint presented in class however it was not working. I will ask during our meeting later this week if resubmission is needed.
